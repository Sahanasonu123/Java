1.Error:-Illegal start of expression.

2.Error:-Illegal start of expression.

3.Compilation Error

4. length is 4 and sum is 100.

6.Method Parameters:-
                      Information can be passed to methods as parameter.Parameters act as
 variables inside the method.Parameters are specified after the method name,
 inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want,
 just separate them with a comma.When the method is called, we pass along a first name,
 which is used inside the method to print the full name.
 
7. Compile-time polymorphism is obtained through method overloading. 
  The word method overloading allows us to have more than one method with the same name.
  Since this process is executed during compile time,
  that's why it is known as "Compile-Time Polymorphism".
  
  examle:
  class ToothPaste{
	
	String colour;
    int price;
	int manufactureDate;
	
	ToothPaste()
	{
		System.out.println("running no-args const");
		
	}
	
	ToothPaste(String colour,int price)
	{
		System.out.println("running string,int const");
		this.price=price;
		this.colour=colour;
		this.manufactureDate=manufactureDate;
		
	}
	
	ToothPaste(String colour,int price,int manufactureDate)
	{
		System.out.println("running string,int,int const");
		this(price,colour);
		this.manufactureDate=manufactureDate;
		
	}
}

8.Var-args:-
           The varrags allows the method to accept zero or muliple arguments.
	Before varargs either we use overloaded method or take an array as the method parameter but 
	it was not considered good because it leads to the maintenance problem.
	If we don't know how many argument we will have to pass in the method,varargs is the better approach.
  Advantage of Varargs:
      We don't have to provide overloaded methods so less code.
  Syntax of varargs:
      The varargs uses ellipsis i.e. three dots after the data type. Syntax is as follows:

             return_type method_name(data_type... variableName){}  
			 
9.Package
    	 Java package is a collection of similar types of sub-packages, interfaces, and classes.
		 
   There are two types of import Explicit & Implicit.When we use predefined java classes 
 in our java code then we need to load that class by the using import keyword at the very first line of our program.
     Explicit import : Classes are available inside the package, Explicit means direct or 
 when we give the proper path of the java class it will call as explicit import.			

10.Constructor chaining
        It is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect
	to current object.One of the main use of constructor chaining is to avoid duplicate codes 
	while having multiple constructor (by means of constructor overloading) and make code 
	more readable.
	
	Example:
	class Oil{
	String brand;
	long quantity;
	int price;

	Oil(String brand,long quantity)
	{
		System.out.println("Running string,long,int constructor in Oil");
		this.brand = brand;
		this.quantity = quantity;
	
	}
	Oil(String brand,long quantity,int price)
	{
	    this(brand,quantity);
		System.out.println("Running string,long,int constructor in Oil");
		this.price = price;
	
	}
	}

14.Enumerations:
        An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
	The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.
	Common examples include compass directions (values of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST) and the days of the week.

15. In JAVA , when we allocate the object using new(), the object is allocated on Heap, 
    otherwise on Stack if not global or static.
	
16.Members of Class:
       Methods
	   Constructor
	   Instance Variables
	   Static Variables
