JAVA TEST

1)JAVA & JAVAC
   Java & javac are JDK tools.javac is used to run the code. and javac is used to compile the file.
   java is a programming language and it is a plotform independent.
   
2)JDK,JRE,JVM
    JDK-JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT
    JRE-JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT:it is used to execute the programs.
    JVM-JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE: It is used to execute actual program.
 
3)LIMITAIONS OF ARRAY
    *If once the Array size is created it cannot be changed.
	*If we want to change the size we have to execute the program again.
    *Array is the container which holds the data in sequence.
 
4)CLASS:- class is a Non primitive datatype.
          class is a blueprint of the object.
		  every class should have the body of the class.
  OBJECT:-object is a realtime entity .
          whatever we are using the things these are all objects.
  
5)WHAT IS ARRAY
   Array is a structured container which holds the data in a sequence manner.
   In array we can use iteration processes.and Array contains index boxes
   
6).java file  :-It  is a readable and understandable for users and developers.It is in english language so everyone can understand.
  .class file :- It is only understands to system because it is in byte code.byte code means it is only in zeroes and ones.
  
7)Length of the Array is:Len=length.data;
  Len=6;
  
9)Java is a programming language. and Java is a plotform independent.
  once the code is compiled it will generate byte codes which are only in zeroes and ones.
  
12)DATATYPES
    Data types are Two types:
	     -Primitive
		 -Non primitive
   Primitive datatyepes are:
	double
	boolean
	int
	float
	short
	byte
   Non Primitive datatyepes are:
	string
	char
	
13) JAVA Features:
            It is plotform Independent.
           object oriented programming language.
		   it has JVM.
		   It has Security.
		   web development.
		   Applications.
		   
16)System.out.println();
      It is a statement
	  system is a pre defined class
      . (dot) is a operator used to access class members
      out is a static variable	
      println is a static method
      in () this parameters we can give any messages we want.it will print for us. 	  
	  
18)Dot operator
             Dot operator is used to access class members.
			 
19)
     base class for all classes is where we have created the main method .			 
			 
20)Java keywords:-
    static
	void 
	string 
	public
	private
	return
	float
	int
	return
	double
	goto
